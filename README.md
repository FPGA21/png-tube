# png-tube
A tiny png tubing app written in HTML5. Most probably the fastest one too.  
![screenshot](https://github.com/FPGA21/png-tube/raw/main/img/screenshot.png)
   
It uses https://github.com/cwilso/volume-meter to check volume levels and uses that data to choose what PNG to draw.   

## Usage:
1. Clone this repo or download as zip file and extract it.    
2. Open up index.html.
## TODO:
Use webgl for rendering and check if thats faster than the current canvas 2D context.
